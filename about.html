      <ol class="ol1">
        <li>
          Limit the use of plastic The news often reports about animals that end
          up choking on plastic waste or marine life getting stuck in plastic
          under water. These are signs that we must try and reduce the use of
          plastic as much as possible in our daily life. Avoid buying plastic
          water bottles; instead, carry your own water bottle whenever you step
          out. Do away with plastic straws and drink directly from the glass.
          Use steel or glass cups instead of plastic ones and carry a cloth bag
          with you every time you go out shopping. You can even turn your old
          jeans or pieces of denim into bags.
        </li>
        <li>
          Segregate the waste Many countries do this and have managed to reduce
          wastes a great deal. We must emulate the best practices and form
          healthful habits, since waste management at home is the need of the
          hour. Segregate garbage into degradable and non-degradable waste. You
          can also create compost at home with leftover food, fruit and
          vegetable peels etc. Waste segregation not only makes the process of
          recycling much easier, but it will also help in maintaining a healthy
          and clean surrounding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce the use of paper Yes, we understand that using no paper at all
          requires a very high level of commitment towards the environment.
          However, what you can do is use as little paper and paper products in
          your home as possible. You can use cloth rags instead of paper towels
          in the kitchen. Maintain soft copies of your journals, rather than
          using a notebook or a diary. Buy e-books instead of hard copies.
          Switch to using handkerchiefs and avoiding tissue papers to wipe your
          hands and face. Prefer metal or eco-friendly bamboo jute plates and
          cutlery instead of using paper plates when needed. Making such small
          changes in your choices can lead to a big change and enable house
          waste management.
        </li>
        <li>
          Say yes to composting Composting can reduce wastes by turning wet
          waste into fertilisers for plants. Besides, if you have or are
          planning to grow your own garden, you will have homemade,
          eco-friendly, chemical-free fertilisers to nourish your green babies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Plan your meals in advance A lot of waste is generated from people
          throwing excess food away because they do not plan their meals in
          advance. One of the ways to reduce waste is planning; it certainly
          helps in reducing food wastage. When well-planned, you will prepare
          only what you need and can consume within a stipulated time, and
          nothing more. In the long run, you will also save your hard-earned
          money by doing this, as it will help you in forming good (grocery)
          buying habits too.
        </li>
        <li>
          Invest in good-quality clothes When you invest in clothes that last
          long, you reduce wastes that is generated due to discarded clothes.
          Good-quality clothes could be a little expensive but they also last
          longer than their cheap counterparts. If you feel fed up with them
          after a while, do not throw them away. Pass them on to the less
          fortunate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pay your bills online The house wastes that can accumulate overtime
          sheerly through bills can be mind-boggling. Choose to pay all your
          bills online. It is faster and paper-free. Ask your banks and other
          sources to send you e-statements or e-bills. Another advantage of this
          method is that you can put it up on your online calendar and make
          automated payments so you never miss a payment.

      <h1 class="ab2">Management of Industrial Waste :</h1>

      <ol class="ol2">
        <li>
          Source Reduction : This should be the most preferred step in reducing
          any type of waste. Reduce the amount of waste your company produces by
          choosing source reduction. To achieve this, you can upgrade raw
          materials or the supply. The reason for this might be that
          higher-quality materials generate less waste. Avoid errors by adding
          quality checks and catch them quickly if they occur. As a result,
          rework and scrap are reduced. Audit your supplier as well and find out
          how they source their materials. After receiving the packaging, speak
          with vendors about reusing the packaging. Don’t use large boxes for
          tiny items, instead, use bins or tubs since they’re reusable. Ensure
          that your employees receive ongoing training to make sure that there
          are no delays in production. Also, consider tracking your output. This
          will let you find areas for improvement. Incorporate well-timed
          deliveries with suppliers to have fewer packaging requirements. This
          will protect against aging, damage, etc. Also, consider buying new
          equipment that’ll produce less scrap.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reusing Waste : Reusing is the best way to conserve material. Reusable
          absorbents are the way to go to help prevent industrial drips and
          leaks. Kitty litter or absorbent pads can be used for this, which
          offers a more sustainable solution compared to single-use products.
          Doing so offers more environmental protection while still providing
          the required protection. For the most cost-effective and eco-friendly
          way to clean filter bags and PPE gloves, opt for a laundering service.
          You can also educate your employees on conserving resources like boxes
          & bubble wrap, not just for business purposes but for their own
          personal use too. For sustainable shipping, it is important to switch
          to reusable pallets while sending items. Let your vendors know that
          you prefer them to be used to ship products to you. If your
          organization produces wastewater, think about engaging in its own
          treatment process. Additionally, hosting a rummage sale to sell things
          like mats and uniforms can be an excellent way to earn extra funds for
          charity. You can then donate the proceeds from this sale to charity
          organizations. Reusable shop towels are a great way to reduce waste,
          improve air quality and save energy. While laundering the towels uses
          up some energy & water, it is still more eco-friendly than creating
          new rags from scratch. By using reusable towels instead, you're also
          reducing the amount of packaging and solid waste created.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recycling and Composting : Instead of disposing of industrial waste in
          the ground, recycling and composting waste are much better solutions.
          Although some waste needs to be disposed of, such as toxic, hazardous
          waste, there is an opportunity to transform materials into something
          useful! You can participate in the fight against waste and make a
          difference. Motivate your employees to either reuse or recycle the
          materials generated by your company or industry. Incentivize or reward
          sustainable initiatives or actions taken by the employees.
        </li>
        <li>
          Segregation : If you have any construction materials such as glass,
          building materials, waste & plastics, it's wise to use separate
          container units for them. This is because these types of items take
          longer to decompose & so keeping them in different containers helps
          manage the waste better.
        </li>
        <li>
          Plasma Gasification : Plasma gasification is a technique that takes
          recyclables from landfills and turns them into energy, ensuring
          nothing goes to waste. Heating up carbon-based materials results in
          syngas production. This gas can be processed into top-notch fuels or
          chemicals, and it can also be used for direct combustion. Plasma
          gasification is an efficient waste management solution to convert
          non-organic material parts into slag. It is cost-effective and
          produces solid, bound residue that can be used as a raw material for
          construction projects. Furthermore, this process helps achieve a
          zero-waste environment, but it is better to understand the toxicity of
          your material before burning it so that you are not polluting the air.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incineration : This should be the least preferred step of industrial
          waste disposal. The incineration of waste releases energy from heat
          and breaks down the combustible material into its basic components.
          Reducing waste this way is an inexpensive method but it produces inert
          ash particles and gases that can pollute the air. The extent of
          pollution is determined by variables such as incineration/combustion
          methods or natural factors. Filters can be used to check for
          pollution. The energy produced from burning waste can be used for
          heating, cooking, and supplying power to turbines. To avoid the
          accidental leak of micro-level contaminants like dioxins, you must
          watch it closely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Landfill : Along with incineration, landfilling should be the least
          preferred step in material disposal. However, it is the most common
          waste disposal method. Items are appropriately buried in the land, and
          only those that can’t be composted or recycled should be placed there.

      <h1 class="ab1">Management of Agricultural Waste :</h1>

      <ol class="ol1">
        <li>
          Composting : Composting is an effective solution for managing plant
          residues, trimmings, manure, and other agricultural products which
          decompose into nutrient-rich compost. The best part is that it can be
          practiced in small-scale and large-scale settings — from home gardens
          to small farms to large agriculture organizations. Compost and organic
          fertilizers made with agricultural waste improve soil fertility,
          increase crop productivity, and reduce (sometimes eliminate) the need
          for synthetic chemical fertilizers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Biogas generation : Biogas production has emerged as a highly
          effective waste management method, especially useful in developing
          countries. Over the past five decades, governments and
          non-governmental institutions have supported the implementation of
          small-scale biogas digesters in rural areas, primarily in Asia, South
          America, and Africa. These digesters convert waste into biogas, a
          renewable energy source that can be used for cooking, heating, and
          electricity generation. The EU is also improving legislation to
          facilitate sustainable agriculture practices by encouraging biogas
          generation as an agricultural waste management solution at scale.
          Biogas not only helps manage agricultural waste effectively but also
          improves living conditions by providing access to cleaner and more
          efficient energy production, reducing air and water pollution, and
          uplifting the overall quality of life.

          Mulching Agricultural solid waste used as mulch helps conserve soil
          moisture, suppress weed growth, and enhance nutrient retention.
          Mulching protects the soil from erosion and temperature fluctuations,
          improving crop health and productivity. The most common and effective
          agricultural wastes for mulching include straw (wheat, rice, or
          barley), hay, crop residues (corn stalks, bean vines, or sugarcane
          tops), leaves, and grass clippings.
        </li>

        <li>
          Recycling packaging materials Agricultural operations use various
          materials, including plastic containers, bags, and packaging, to
          facilitate crop planting, harvesting, and transportation. While these
          materials are essential for ensuring efficient and hygienic
          agricultural practices, their widespread use amplifies the effects of
          agricultural waste on the environment. Proper recycling involves
          collecting, sorting, and processing plastic materials to transform
          them into new products or raw materials for manufacturing. An
          agriculture organization participating in recycling programs
          contributes to the circular economy, reducing the demand for new raw
          materials and conserving natural resources.

      <h1 class="ab2">Management of Medical Waste :</h1>

      <ol class="ol2">
        <li>
          Medical Waste Treatment Methods : Before any waste is disposed of in
          landfills, it must be determined whether that waste is safe. There are
          several treatment technologies that sterilize medical waste before it
          is disposed of, effectively making it less hazardous. Treatment of
          medical waste helps ensure infectious waste, potentially infectious
          agents or toxic items do not seep into the soil or nearby water
          sources at landfills and create a risk to the environment and the
          general public. Below are some of the treatments being used today.
        </li>
        <li>
          Autoclaving : Autoclaving provides sterilization through steam. Though
          autoclaving is a good solution for sterilizing microbiological wastes,
          it is not an appropriate solution for other types of waste such as
          pathological and toxic chemicals.
        </li>
        <li>
          Chemical Disinfection : Chemical disinfection is usually reserved for
          chemical and liquid waste. Chlorine is a common chemical used during
          this process. The types of microorganisms in the waste and how
          contaminated the product is determines whether this is an effective
          choice for sterilization.
        </li>
        <li>
          Microwaving : Irradiative sterilization uses the same technology as
          microwaves to disinfect waste. Waste is shredded and mixed with water.
          The waste is then heated so that all biological elements are
          neutralized.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incineration : Incineration typically used as a disposal method for
          pathological waste and pharmaceutical waste. During this process,
          medical waste incinerators reach temperatures as hot as 2,000 degrees
          F. Trace chemotherapy waste is permitted under California law to
          undergo the incineration process.

      <h1 class="ab1">Management of Constructional Waste :</h1>

      <ol class="ol1">
        <li>
          Donate Unwanted Construction Materials : Some construction waste or
          materials that are useless to us may help some local or needful
          people. Sometimes décor items or old appliances can find a new home by
          donating.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reuse or Recycle of Construction Waste : The best option to prevent
          the disposal of construction waste is to reduce it. If that is not
          achieved, it is necessary to have the utmost patience to check all the
          possibilities to reuse or recycle the construction debris. For
          example, broken tools and scrap metals, when fused, can form a single
          décor that can be used for garden ornaments or any other useful tool.
          If there is no time to repurpose the waste, it can be sold as scrap to
          the people who perform recycling procedures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Landfilling by Construction Waste : Landfilling option, as mentioned
          above, is only performed by satisfying the standards and permissions
          of the region or state. A C&D waste landfill does not receive
          hazardous waste or industrial or chemical waste. The primary
          construction waste materials received by the landfills are: 1.Road
          work construction waste. 2.Construction or renovation waste. 3.Site
          clearance waste

      <h1 class="ab2">Management of E-Waste :</h1>

      <ol class="ol2">
        <li>
          Secured land-filling : The e-waste is built on flat land and the pits
          are pressed into the soil by putting the e-waste in it. Should be
          pressed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Insinuation : In this process, the e-waste is lit in a fully closed
          chamber inside the insulator at a temperature of 900 to 1000 degree
          centigrade. Due to this the quantity of e-waste is reduced
          considerably and the toxicity of the organic substance present in it
          is reduced significantly. The smoke and gas coming out of the chimney
          in the injector is passed through the Air Pollution Control System
          (APCS) and the various types of metals present in the smoke are
          separated by chemical action and the gases are treated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recycling : Devices such as electronic waste, monitors, picture tubes,
          laptops, keyboards, telephones, hard drives, CD drives, fax machines,
          printers, CPUs, modem cables etc. can be recycled. In this process,
          various metals and plastics are sabotaged separately and preserved for
          reuse.
        </li>
        <li>
          Metal recovery by acid : Different types of parts like ferrous and
          non-ferrous metal and printed circuit boards are separated by
          electronic waste. Different types of metals like lead, copper,
          aluminum, silver, gold, platinum, etc. are used for the recovery of
          metals by using concentrates. Residue plastic waste is recycled for
          reuse.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reuse :
           Old electronic devices are repaired and made for reuse. – Such
          as computers, mobiles, laptops, inkjet cartage, inverter, television /
          LCD, UPS, printers, etc. can be properly reused and reused. So, by
          implementing above mention 5 ways you can easily dispose of, recycle &
          reused your e-waste efficiently which not only helps you to reuse but
          also helps to keep the environment clean & safe.
